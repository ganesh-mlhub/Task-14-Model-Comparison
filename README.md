# Task 14 – Model Comparison & Best Model Selection

## Objective
Compare multiple machine learning models and select the best performing one using evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
Titanic Dataset (Seaborn)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Results
A comparison table and bar chart were created to analyze model performance.
Random Forest was selected as the best model based on F1-score and generalization.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Output
- Model comparison table
- Performance comparison plot
- Saved best model (`best_model.pkl`)
